OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTS Project: Python Programming OBJECTIVES The objective of this project is to perform Python programming on a dataset containing basic program data such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The aim is to cover the basic knowledge of Python programming.

KEY ACTIVITIES

Writing Code: Developing scripts and applications using Python syntax and libraries. This includes creating functions, classes, and modules. Debugging: Identifying and fixing errors or bugs in the code. This can involve using debugging tools, reading error messages, and writing test cases. Testing: Writing and executing tests to ensure the code works as expected. This can include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like pytest or unittest. TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR PYTHON

Idle Python 3.12.6 version tool TASK 1 ANALYSIS:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers. Allow the user to choose an arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Perform the chosen operation. Display the result of the operation. Function Definitions: Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation:

add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y. subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y. multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y. divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y, with error handling for division by zero.
